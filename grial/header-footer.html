        <h2>What are Blue Zones?</h2>
        <p>Blue zones are regions of the world where people live much longer than average. Researchers identified several key areas, including Okinawa (Japan), Sardina (Italy), Nicoya (Costa Rica), Ikaria (Greece), and Loma Linda (California, USA).</p>

        <h2>Common Habits of Long-Lived People</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>PLant-based diets rich in vegetables, beans, and whole grains.</li>
            <li>Regular physical activity integrated into daily life, like walking or gardening</li>
            <li>Strong social connections and family support.</li>
            <li>Stress reduction through mediation, prayer, or relaxation rituals.</li>
            <li>Having a sense of purpose, which motivates daily life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Longevity Matters</h2>
